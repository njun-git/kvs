## About kvs Repository

This repository is a collection of source codes using kvs.

> [Kyoto Visualization System (KVS)](http://code.google.com/p/kvs/) is a multi-platform, open-source C++ library for developing scientific visualization applications. KVS provides various classes and interfaces , such as isosurace extraction, streamlines and volume rendering, to visualize medical data obtained by computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, numerical data from computational fluid dynamics and so on. KVS also provides some viewing classes for the VR display system, such as CAVE immersive display and tiled display system.  

## Directories
### [OpenGL : opengl](https://github.com/njun-git/kvs/wiki/OpenGL)

'opengl' directory consists of kvs examples using OpenGL.

### [GLEW : glew](https://github.com/njun-git/kvs/wiki/GLEW)

'glew' directory consists of kvs examples using OpenGL and GLSL.  
It requires the installation of [GLEW (The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library)](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) to compile and execute programs.

### [Visualization : viz](https://github.com/njun-git/kvs/wiki/Visualization)

'viz' directory consists of kvs source codes for visualization.  
It also requires the installation of GLEW to compile and execute programs.
